### Does mpv have an official GUI?

No. But there is the OSC (on-screen-controller), which lets you control playback with the mouse.

### I can't see the OSC/OSD/GUI!

The OSC requires Lua support. Install Lua (including development headers) and rebuild mpv.
If you didn't build mpv yourself, ask the packager to enable Lua.

Also note that the OSC is invisible by default, but it should appear once you move the mouse over the mpv window.
