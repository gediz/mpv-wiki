# Applications using mpv

Here is a list of third-party programs which use mpv or libmpv in some form. These are **unofficial 3rd party projects** which are not necessarily directly supported by mpv. Anyone can add their own project by editing this wiki.


## GUI frontends

* [xt7-player-mpv](https://github.com/kokoko3k/xt7-player-mpv):  
  A frontend to mpv with extra features.

* [Baka MPlayer](https://github.com/u8sand/Baka-MPlayer):  
   A media player based on libmpv.

* [mpc-qt](https://github.com/cmdrkotori/mpc-qt):  
   A media player based on libmpv which aims to reproduce most of the interface and functionality of mpc-hc.

## Other

* [SpaceTV](https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm-plugins/wiki#wiki-ig-spacetv):  
  SpaceTV is an mpv-based plugin for the [SpaceFM](http://ignorantguru.github.io/spacefm/) file manager which allows SpaceFM to be used as a media center.  Since mpv doesn't include a GUI, SpaceFM can be used to select videos to play in mpv, and adds the ability to Resume Last and Resume Prior played videos.

  SpaceTV's [spacetv.sh script](https://raw.github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm-plugins/master/ig-spacetv/src/cstm_325c1cf6/spacetv.sh) can also be used independently of SpaceFM (it requires only mpv) to add more resume functionality to mpv.  It remembers the names of unfinished videos and can resume the last video played, or can step backwards through prior played videos.
