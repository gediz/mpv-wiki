# Applications using mpv

Here is a list of third-party programs which use mpv or libmpv in some form. These are **unofficial 3rd party projects** which are not necessarily directly supported by mpv. Anyone can add their own project by editing this wiki.

## GUI frontends

* [Baka MPlayer](https://github.com/u8sand/Baka-MPlayer):  
  A media player based on libmpv.

* [bomi](http://bomi-player.github.io):  
  bomi is a media player based on mpv for Linux. By taking advantage of mpv and GUI, bomi provides various features. Not really a frontend - uses an internal mpv fork instead of libmpv. Currently outdated and unmaintained.

* [gnome-mpv](https://github.com/gnome-mpv/gnome-mpv):  
  A simple GTK+ frontend for mpv.

* [IINA](https://lhc70000.github.io/iina/):  
  A media player for macOS 10.10+ based on mpv.

* [mochi-player](https://mochi-player.github.io/):  
  Rewrite of Baka using Qt Quick + QML.

* [mpc-qt](https://github.com/cmdrkotori/mpc-qt):  
  A media player based on libmpv which aims to reproduce most of the interface and functionality of mpc-hc.

* [mpv-android](https://github.com/mpv-android/mpv-android):  
  A media player for Android devices based on libmpv.

* [SMPlayer](http://smplayer.sourceforge.net/):  
  A cross-platform graphical front-end for MPlayer and forks of Mplayer using GUI widgets offered by Qt.

* [xt7-player-mpv](https://github.com/kokoko3k/xt7-player-mpv):  
  A frontend to mpv with extra features.

## Other

* [boram](https://github.com/Kagami/boram):  
  boram is a cross-platform WebM converter which embeds libmpv as Chromium PPAPI plugin in order to preview and interactively cut/crop media file to be encoded.

* [PlexMediaPlayer](https://github.com/plexinc/plex-media-player):  
  A Plex GUI client (provides access to Plex servers), which uses libmpv for video and music playback.

* [SpaceTV](https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm-plugins/wiki#wiki-ig-spacetv):  
  SpaceTV is an mpv-based plugin for the [SpaceFM](http://ignorantguru.github.io/spacefm/) file manager which allows SpaceFM to be used as a media center.  Since mpv doesn't include a GUI, SpaceFM can be used to select videos to play in mpv, and adds the ability to Resume Last and Resume Prior played videos.

  SpaceTV's [spacetv.sh script](https://raw.github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm-plugins/master/ig-spacetv/src/cstm_325c1cf6/spacetv.sh) can also be used independently of SpaceFM (it requires only mpv) to add more resume functionality to mpv.  It remembers the names of unfinished videos and can resume the last video played, or can step backwards through prior played videos.

* [webm.py](https://github.com/Kagami/webm.py):  
  Converter which uses mpv for interactive cutting and cropping of videos being transcoded to WebM.
