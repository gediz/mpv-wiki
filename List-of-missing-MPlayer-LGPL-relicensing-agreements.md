- Christian <herr.mitterlehner@gsmpaaiml.com> (host not found) (osd-fractions option patch, reworked by uau)
- Alan Curry <pacman@world.std.com> (relatively trivial changes to vd_ffmpeg.c and demux_lavf.c and other areas, most contributions in removed code)
- Tom Lees <tal26@cam.ac.uk> (trivial ao_alsa patch, code was probably removed)


People who were contacted, but did not reply
------------------------------------------------
- Michel Lespinasse (part of his libmpeg2 video output changes might have been used as skeleton for vo.h - NOTE: probably doesn't matter, as we won't relicense the X11 code, and other than that literally nothing is left)
- Dénes Balatoni (introduces demux_control, also early slave commands for getting time/position, probably turned into later properties)
- kiriuja (audio track runtime switching be54f4813fdc9, option parser changes 43844d090c55, subtitle loading stuff (not sure if removed/replaced), video equalizer fix, some early slave mode things)
- Sidik Isani (-autosync code, absolute seeks for -ss, rest was probably removed)
- Mark Zealey (early -geometry option code)
- Ville Syrjälä (svn name syrjala, did vo_dfbmga.c, which we removed, but a patch for nv12 touches other areas)
- seru (OSD changes 8d190244d21a4d4, some other insignificant changes) (agreement probably not needed - everything removed)
- Eviv Bulgroz (messes with stream seeking code in 2aa6acd9747ae, other changes not needed) (also apparently not a real name)
- Melchior Franz (-geometry extensions 90188f0e5fce)
- Sam Dennis (minor fix to mplayer.c, his changes to demux_mkv.c were pretty much removed)
- R.L. Horn (small patch for ALSA audio output)
- rvm (most likely Ricardo Villalba) (-volume option, exit reason stuff in mplayer.c)
- Laurent (stream EOF fix a0f08fbebbdf)
- Zoltan Hidvegi (hzoli) (messes with common audio decode code in 067c0482d99d, vd_ffmpeg.c change in b49ee1f782340, other changes not needed)
- Chris Welton (small demux_lavf API change update 958c41d9b69843)
- Wei Jiang (small bug fixes in 2004, most memleaks)
- Paul Lebedev (track names in demux_mkv 62bfae140613321a, probably nothing copyrightable left)
- rguyom (some very early vd_ffmpeg.c fixes)
- Nehal Mistry (some win32 mouse code, maybe or not still in w32_common.c)
- "veal" in commit 116ca0c768219b10e, osd_show_property_text command, probably became show_text?
- Nikolay Nikolaev (-http-header-fields option that is sort of present even in the new http code)
- Kir Kostuchenko (some TV changes - TV will stay GPL, but this touches common mplayer.c code that should become LGPL)
- Loren Merritt (apart from mencoder, some small changes)
- Arwed von Merkatz (a patch for CDDA, the patches for removed fontconfig support are not needed)
- Bernd Ernesti (portability patches - unclear if anything survived, TV patches not needed)
- Vladimir Kushnir (very early BSD portability changes, unclear if anything survived)
- Rune Petersen (Windows -priority option 14ecebe920e68f1)
- James Warden (add 32 bit sample format to pulseaudio output, trivial)

- nVidia Corporation (most vdpau code, they said they're "looking into" the relicensing request)
