# User Scripts

Here is a list of scripts that users of mpv have published, adding functionality that is not part of the core mpv player:

* **[last.fm scrobbler](https://github.com/l29ah/w3crapcli/blob/master/last.fm/mpv-lastfm.lua)** - Sends the information about playing tracks to [last.fm](http://last.fm/), see http://www.last.fm/help/faq?category=99 for more info.

* **[excerpt](https://github.com/lvml/plugins/tree/master/excerpt)** - Allows you to quickly create excerpts from media files, you just have to set begin and end markers.

If you want to write your own scripts, have a look at the [documentation of mpv's Lua interface](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/man/lua.rst).
