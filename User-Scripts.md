# User Scripts

Here is a list of scripts that users of mpv have published, adding functionality that is not part of the core mpv player:

* **[last.fm scrobbler](https://github.com/mpv-player/plugins/tree/master/last.fm-scrobbler)** - to be described

* **[excerpt](https://github.com/lvml/plugins/tree/master/excerpt)** - Allows you to quickly create excerpts from media files, you just have to set begin and end markers.

If you want to write your own scripts, have a look at the [documentation of mpv's Lua interface](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/man/lua.rst).
