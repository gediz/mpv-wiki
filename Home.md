For now, you can have a look at the manpages:

- PDF rendering of the manpages: http://mpv.srsfckn.biz/manual.pdf
- via github's rst renderer: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/tree/master/DOCS/man (doesn't render everything well)

Keep in mind the manpages here refer to mpv git master, not the release!
