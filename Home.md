For now, you can have a look at the manpages, which are accessible from the web via github's rst renderer: [https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/tree/master/DOCS/man/en](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/tree/master/DOCS/man/en)

(Unfortunately, the github renderer sucks, and some formatting ends up strangeor broken.)
